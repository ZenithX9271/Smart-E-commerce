#Smart E-commerce Inventory Recommender System

A **DSA-rich, real-world Python project** that simulates an intelligent inventory recommender for e-commerce platforms. It helps decide **what products to restock**, **which suppliers to choose**, and **which items are in-demand or running low** â€” all powered by advanced algorithms and data structures.

> Designed to showcase core DSA concepts: **Dynamic Programming**, **Heaps**, **Priority Queues**, and **HashMaps**.
